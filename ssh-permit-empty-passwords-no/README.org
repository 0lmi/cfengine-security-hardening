User accounts should have passwords. Without passwords users can't be held accountable for their actions.

If possible it is recommended to inhibit the use of passwords at all and instead realy on keys with

```
PasswordAuthentication no  
```

but inhibiting login with empty passwords is an excellent fallback and good to have present in case a situation prevents the use of keys.

* How it works

This module ensures that =PermitEmptyPasswords= is set to =no= in =/etc/ssh/sshd_config= leveraging =lib_sshd_config:global_key_values= from the [[https://build.cfengine.com/modules/inventory-local-users][lib-sshd-config]] module.
