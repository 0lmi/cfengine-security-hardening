#+title: default-encrypt-method-sha512

This module makes sure the default password hashing algorithm is =SHA512=. Yes, it's a bit of a mis-nomer, but that stems from the historical details, namely the key =ENCRYPT_METHOD= in =/etc/login.defs=.

- Ensure Password Hashing Algorithm in =/etc/libuser.conf= (SHA512)
  - =crypt_style = sha512=
- Ensure Password Hashing Algorithm in =/etc/login.defs= (SHA512)
  - =ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512=

Note: This policy only ensures the default algorithm is set, it does nothing with respect to users who have passwords hashed using a different algorithm.
