If the "sudoers" file is not configured correctly, any user defined on the system can initiate privileged actions on the target system.

This module ensures the following lines are not present in =/etc/sudoers.conf=.

- =ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL=
- =ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL=

*Warning:* As the exact requirement allows exceptions, and removing lines from the sudoers file can make the system non-administrable. If you wish to run this policy in warn instead of fix mode, ensure the class =default:sudo_enforce_allowed_users_warn= is defined.

*Note:* This module does not currently attempt to manage configuration from included files, e.g. (=/etc/sudoers.d/=).

* Configuration

- =default:sudo_enforce_allowed_users_warn= :: When defined the policy will only warn about lines that would be deleted instead of actually deleting them. (not defined by default)
