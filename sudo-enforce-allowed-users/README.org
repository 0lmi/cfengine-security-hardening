If the /sudoers/ file is not configured correctly, any user defined on the system can initiate privileged actions on the target system.

This module ensures the following lines are not present in =/etc/sudoers.conf=. By default this module operates with an action policy of =warn= which will simply warn when it would remove the lines. Change the behavior of the policy to automatically removing the lines by setting =default:sudo_enforce_allowed_users.action_policy=.

- =ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL=
- =ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL=

*Note:* This module does not currently attempt to manage configuration from included files, e.g. (=/etc/sudoers.d/=).

* Configuration

- =default:sudo_enforce_allowed_users.action_policy= :: When defined the policy will only warn about lines that would be deleted instead of actually deleting them. Valid range ( =warn= | =fix= | =nop= ), default =warn=.
